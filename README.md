Another HSL(A) / RGB(A) Colorpicker • jQuery Plugin


Most color picker work on HSV or HSB base , where you can enter any HSL(A) values​​. But what can I do with an HSV/B color value on the web? Graphics programs usually use both the HSV/B- as well as the RGB model, the one that is also color values ​​by the program can take into the net, or vice versa, without having to resort to HSV/B. So why not use a color picker for the HSL color system, which still has the advantage to be considered as relatively simple and easy to follow for people?

If you scoured the documentation and the demos of jQuery UI , one encounters the slider widget to an example that demonstrates a simple RGB color picker. That gave me the idea that it should be possible to script a visually pleasing RGB(A)/HSL(A) color picker in conjunction with CSS3 - of course as jQuery plugin.

It was important to me in particular, that can be easily adjusted via the slider its color values ​​and do not need to enter cumbersome to input fields, as is the case with most pickers. In addition, the color picker should be the individual needs to act adaptable and flexible.

Well, pick Slide is finished in its first version...
